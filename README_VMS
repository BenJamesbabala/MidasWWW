                         VAX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                                       
   These instructions are for the VAX. See  README file for UNIX installation
   instructions. 
   
Requirements

   To install this version of MidasWWW you will need a VAX running VMS 5.4 or
   greater, with DecWindows/Motif and C installed. You will also need  MMS to
   be able to build MidasWWW in the standard way (although you could certainly
   build MidasWWW without MMS if you do a little more work).  
   
   Currently  MidasWWW has only been run with  Multinet TCP/IP software. It
   should be possible to run it with other versions of TCP/IP for the VAX
   without too much trouble, if you succeed please feed the changes back to 
   me. 
   
Obtaining MidasWWW

   You can obtain MidasWWW as a compressed TAR file via  anonymous FTP from 
   FreeHEP.Scri.Fsu.Edu, in directory  
   

/pub/freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww

   In this case you will need  TAR2VMS  and some way to uncompress the file (I
   don't know of a VMS version of uncompress...I usually uncompress files on
   UNIX and then ship the tar file to VMS). 
   
   Alternatively if you are on HEPNET you can get a VMS  BACKUP  version of
   MidasWWW using DECNET from:  
   

SLACVX::DISK$SLD_FAC0:[EXPORT]MIDASWWW_1_0.BCK

   (SLACVX is HEPNET node 44.481). To unpack the backup file use the command: 
   

$ backup/log MIDASWWW_1_0.BCK/save *.*

Building

   Once you have obtained MidasWWW and unpacked it, set your default directory
   to be the directory containing the unpacked files. To build MidasWWW use the
   following command: 
   

$ mms all

Testing

   To try out MidasWWW first make sure your X windows DISPLAY is set up
   correctly (use the  SET DISPLAY command to set it). Then issue the command: 
   

$ mms test

   Please ignore the message 
   

X Toolkit Warning: Urm__FetchLiteral: Can't find literal 'MidasWWWIcon' - MrmNO
T_FOUND

   This is a known bug. 
   
Installing

   To install MidasWWW five files must be placed in a public area. These are: 
   
  MIDASWWW.EXE           The executable file  
                         
  MIDAS.UID              User Interface definition file 
                         
  MIDASWWW.UID           User Interface definition file 
                         
  MIDAS.DAT              X-resource file 
                         
  MIDASWWW.DAT           X-resource file 
                         
   If you do not install all five files MidasWWW will not run. The .EXE file
   can be installed anywhere (for example in the SYS$SYSTEM: directory), and a
   suitable global symbol should be defined in the system login file. A
   suitable definition is: 
   

$ MIDASWWW == "$SYS$SYSTEM:MIDASWWW -NAME MIDASWWW"

   The four remaining files must be installed in a directory pointed to by the
   logical name DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS, for example in
   SYS$COMMON:[DECW$DEFAULTS.USER]. 
   
   Once this has been done your users will be able to start MidasWWW by using
   the command: 
   

$ MIDASWWW

Starting MidasWWW from your Session Manager

   If you wish "World Wide Web" to appear in the applications menu of your
   DecWindows session manager or FileView then you must install two more files.
   These are: 
   
  MIDASWWW.VUE$DAT       Defines an entry in the "Application" menu 
                         
  VUE$MIDASWWW.COM       Runs MidasWWW from FileView 
                         
   (These files are only included in the BACKUP version of the MidasWWW
   distribution). Both files must be installed in a directory pointer to by
   VUE$LIBRARY, for example SYS$COMMON:[VUE$LIBRARY.USER]. 
   
   Please let me know if you encounter any problems.
