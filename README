                        UNIX INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
                                       
   These instructions are for UNIX. See the README_VMS file for VMS
   installation instructions. 
   
Requirements

   To install this version of MidasWWW you will need a Unix system with X
   windows (X11R4 or X11R5) and Motif (version 1.1.0 or greater). 
   
   The current version has been tested on the following systems: 
   
      SGI - Indigo (4.0.5) 
      
      RS6000 (AIX 3.2.2) 
      
      HP-UX 
      
   MidasWWW should be portable to other unix systems. Please let  me know if
   you port it to other systems, and let me know of any changes you had to
   make. 
   
Obtaining MidasWWW

   You can obtain MidasWWW as a compressed TAR file via  anonymous FTP from 
   FreeHEP.Scri.Fsu.Edu, in directory  
   

/pub/freehep/networking_email_news/midaswww

   After obtaining the TAR file, uncompress it and detar it using the commands:
   

uncompress midaswww-1.0.tar.Z
tar -xvf midaswww-1.0.tar
cd midaswww-1.0

Building

   There are two ways to go about building MidasWWW. The way that is in
   principle recommended is to use the standard X-windows utility xmkmf
   (x-make-makefile). This facility is supposed to take into account any
   machine dependencies, and to correctly link against the correct libraries on
   your machine. I have found a number of problems with using xmkmf however: 
   
      It appears not to be installed on many machines 
      
      It doesn't appear to always do as good a job as one would like in
      removing machine dependencies. 
      
   Consequently we support two ways of building MidasWWW, with xmkmf or without
   xmkmf, choose one! 
   
  WITH XMKMF
  
   Build MidasWWW as follows: 
   

xmkmf
make

  WITHOUT XMKMF
  
   Choose the one of the following makefiles: 
   
Makefile.sgi    Makefile.aix32  Makefile.hp 

   If a standard makefile doesn't exist for your machine, then either try using
   xmkmf or try making one yourself using one of the above as a starting point.
   If you succeed please send the new Makefile back to me so that others can
   benefit from your work. 
   
   Then use the following commands (where MMMM is the makefile you chose): 
   

cp MMMM Makefile
make

Testing

   To try out MidasWWW first make sure your DISPLAY envirnonment variable is
   set up correctly.  Then issue the command: 
   

$ make test

   Please ignore the message 
   

X Toolkit Warning: Urm__FetchLiteral: Can't find literal 'MidasWWWIcon' - MrmNO
T_FOUND

   This is a known bug. 
   
  NOTES
  
   On HP machines these extra error messages are generated: 
   

Warning: translation table syntax error: Missing ':'after event sequence.
Warning: ... found while parsing ''

   I have no idea why but they don't seem to do any harm. 
   
Installation

   At run time there are five files that must be successfully accessed in order
   for MidasWWW to run correctly. These files are: 
   
  midaswww               The binary executable file 
                         
  midas.uid              User Interface Description file 
                         
  midaswww.uid           User Interface Description file 
                         
  Midas.ad               X-Applications Default File 
                         
  Midaswww.ad            X-Applications Default File 
                         
   If you do not install all five files MidasWWW will not run. 
   
   The following commands will install MidasWWW for public use on most systems.
   

cp midaswww     /usr/bin/X11/midaswww
cp midas.uid    /usr/lib/X11/uid/midas.uid
cp midaswww.uid /usr/lib/X11/uid/midaswww.uid
cp Midas.ad     /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Midas
cp Midaswww.ad  /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Midaswww

   Once this is done the MidasWWW browser can be run using the command 
   

midaswww

  NOTES
  
      The directory /usr/lib/X11/uid often doesn't exist and must be greated
      using mkdir. 
      
      The uid files must be installed in a directory searched by the routine
      MrmOpenHierarchy. See the man page for that routine for more details. 
      
      The .ad files must be installed in the appropriate app-defaults
      directory, WITHOUT the .ad suffix.
